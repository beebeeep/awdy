Are We Done Yet?
================

Finally, a task tracker that doesn't suck. You got 4 lanes, tags, title, and description - do you really need anything else?
This is local version, for personal use. I will add multi-user, network-enabled version later, if I'll be bored enough.

Key bindings
------------
**Tab** to move between tags/lanes, **arrows** or **hjkl** to navigate between lanes and tasks. 
**n** to create new task.

**Enter** to open task, **a** to archive task (tag it as "Archive", tasks with that tag are not shown by default).

In task view, use **Tab** to navigate between fields, **Ctrl+s** to save task and return back to main view.
